# 20191014 SWC: collaborating with git

## Objective

Test out problem solving when collaborating with others (and ourselves) using git and GitHub.

## Method

Each participant adds a plain text file named as their uniqname (e.g. `diaorch.txt`, or initials, e.g. `rd.txt`), to directory `collaboration/` in the cloned repo. The file is a text file including one line of text describing "one thing you noticed on your way to this workshop".
